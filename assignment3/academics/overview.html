						At Northern Vermont University, our curriculum isn't confined 
						to the classroom. It's out in the community. It's online. And 
						it's always tailored to the working world—starting year one, 
						day one, with internships, site visits, exercises, travel and 
						collaborative research. Exploring your future careers, you'll 
						gain a greater sense for what's out there—and be prepared to 
						hit the ground running.
